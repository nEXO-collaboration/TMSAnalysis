    "# Cross Sectional Lifetime Dependence\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will attempt to analyze the electron lifetime (roughly, using the \"LifetimeEstimation\" class) as a function of (x,y) channels of the charge tile in the long TPC at Stanford. The analysis will be carried out using data from Runs 29, 30, 31, and 34, purification test runs with high statistics, on datasets with known lifetimes calculated. (Purification tests are performed by injection Rn-220 gas into the chamber, then waiting for the Bi-212 alpha decays to dominate before taking data.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following process will be used:\n",
    "- Separate the data into channels (readouts of individuals/groups preserved); plot tile energy vs. drift time per channel\n",
    "- Fit a lifetime to the plots\n",
    "- Analyze the stastics of all the lifetimes (mainly mean and std. dev)\n",
    "- Repeat for multiple datasets, multiple runs to see if any patterns exist\n",
    "\n",

    "- Each channel in each dataset has its own name with its own naming convention, so there's no great way that I know of to extract all the channel names, unless there's something I can do with a grep if it can extract the whole title after grepping only part of it, and then store the names in some long array\n",
    "- Each channel (or group of channels) has its own proprietary cuts and intercept guess, so if I were to run this program for a whole list of datasets, I would have to cut each channel's data appropriately and make accurate intercept guesses, then record and store these values in long arrays\n",
    "- If I wanted to estimate the lifetime for a group of channels, I would have to modify existing functions to change the masking, like I did for the individual channels (my class/code needs a serious cleaning)\n",

    "NOTE after the meeting:\n",
    "- Don't be stupid; if the channels have such low counts, then it's likely all noise there. I'll have to group together tiles accordingly in a meaningful way to get meaningful results out of this.\n",
    "- It seems like I should explore the plotting of charge energy vs total drift time and individual drift time to see how different they are (plotted with the same cuts, of course)"
