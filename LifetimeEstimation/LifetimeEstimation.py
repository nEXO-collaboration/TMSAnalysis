###### Lifetime Estimation.py ######
#
# This class is intended to be used with reduced datasets from purification tests,
# serving as a means to estimate the electron lifetime of the liquid in the time
# projection chamber (TPC).
# 
# The class assumes a Poisson-distributed probability of an individual 
# recombination of a free electron in the medium of the TPC, thereby making the 
# recombination of all free electrons in the medium follow an exponential 
# distribution.
#
# The class works around the noise of the reduced datasets by fitting to a plot
# of total tile energy vs. drift time of the chamber, fitting datapoints to 
# slices of drift time in the whole dataset. In other words, the tile energy vs. 
# drift time is split into intervals of drift time (not equally-spaced intervals),
# and in each slice, the events are histogrammed according to tile energy, then
# fit to a Gaussian, the centroid of which is taken as the mean tile energy that 
# arrived in that drift slice. Those centroids are then used as the fit points 
# for the exponential distribution. The natural log of those points is taken for 
# a linear least-squares fit, the slope of which is the opposite of the reciprocal
# of the lifetime.
# 
# This class is intended to be used after quality cuts on Tile and SiPM energy are
# determined by the user to see clearly the alpha band present in purification data
# when plotted as tile energy vs. drift time. These quality cuts are inputs to the 
# fitting function.
# 
# Methods:
# 
# gauss(x, A, x0, sigma) - A standard Gaussian function that calculates 
#                          y = A*e^(-(x - x0)^2/(2*sigma^2)) for a dataset x and for
#                          parameters A, x0, and sigma. Returns the y array.
#
# gauss_fit(x, y) - A Gaussian fitting function that utilizes scipy.optimize.curve_fit()
#                   to fit x and y data to a Gaussian. Returns the parameters of the 
#                   Gaussian along with a covariance matrix.
#
# freedmanDiaconis(data, returnas="width") - A function that determines the "ideal" 
#                                            number of bins with which to histogram
#                                            a given dataset. Returns either the bin width
#                                            or the number of bins to use.
#
# lsLin(xs, ys) - A function that performs a linear, least-squares fit on a set of data (xs,
#                 ys). Returns the slope, intercept, their respective uncertainties, R^2,
#                 and the number of fit points.
#
# cutDriftSlices(various) - A function that takes the tile energy vs. drift time data from a 
#                           run, and with square quality cuts on tile and SiPM energy, bins
#                           the data into drift slices of non-uniform length based on what is
#                           statistically sound for histogramming/fitting to a Gaussian, and 
#                           returns those slices along with other information. Called within
#                           binnedElectronLifetimeFit().
#

#                                     to the alpha band of the purification data, and fits a 
#                                     Gaussian to that data, returning the mean and std. dev of the 
#                                     fit along with other relevant statistics. Called within 
#                                     binAndFitChargeData(), which is itself called within
#                                     binnedElectronLifetimeFit().
#
# binAndFitChargeData(various) - A function that takes the tile energy vs. drift time data from a 
#                                run, and with linear cuts on the tile energy, square cuts on the
#                                SiPM energy, and slices of drift time, histograms the tile data
#                                in each slice, then fits those histograms to a Gaussian to extract
#                                the centroids for the lifetime fit, returning the centroids, their
#                                uncertainties, and other relevant statistics. Called within
#                                binnedElectronLifetimeFit().
#
# binnedElectronLifetimeFit(various) - The function that takes the data from a run, splits
#                                      it into drift slices, histograms those slices, fits
#                                      them to a Gaussian, then takes those centroids and 
#                                      fits the natural log of them to a line. Returns the 
#                                      left edges of the drift slices, the centroids of the
#                                      Gaussian fit, their uncertainties, the lifetime,
#                                      the intercept of the exponential fit, their uncertainties,
#                                      and the R^2 of the linear fit used with the log(centroids).
#
# NOTE/WARNING 1: There are some lines in binnedElectronLifetimeFit() that have values 
# that contain hard-coded numbers; these numbers were used empirically based on the
# reduced_v9 datasets from Run 34 and will likely need to be replaced by more robust
# and dynamic calculation methods/thresholds for other datasets and for more general
# usage. (The values that contain hard-coded numbers are threshold values for 
# conditional statements and the slice thickness gradient.)
#
# NOTE 2: The class utilizes somewhat centrally scipy.optimize.curve_fit() for the 
# Gaussian fitting and a hand-written function for the least-squares fit. In future
# revisions of this class, lmfit should be used in place of both of these functions, 
# just to get a better fit, better handling of all uncertainties, and a better
# visualization of the fit with all uncertainties involved. 
#
# ChangeLog:
# 2022-08-16 MM Created.
# 2023-01-11 MM Added methods for lifetime estimation of tile "nodes," i.e. where
#               an x and y tile meet (to continue fitting to 3D data only)

# freedmanDiaconis()
#
# freedmanDiaconis() calculates an "ideal" or acceptable width of histogram bins
# for a given dataset based on the Freedman-Diaconis rule. 
#
# Paraphrased from Wikipedia: The Freedman-Diaconis rule is a rule that can be used
# to determine the number of bins for a histogram, based on minimizing (roughly) the
# integral of the squared difference between the relative frequency density and the 
# theoretical probability distribution (i.e. between the bin heights and the Gaussian).
# The bin width predicted by this rule is:
# 
#                bw = 2*IQR(x)/n^(1/3),
# 
# where bw is the bin width, n is the number of datapoints in a dataset/array x, and 
# IQR is the interquartile range of the data, namely the "middle 50%" of the data, or 
# the difference/width between the 25th and 75th percentiles of normally-distributed 
# data. In other words, the IQR of normally-distributed data spans from the mean 
# -0.6745*(std. dev) to the mean + 0.6745*(std. dev) of the data. See Wikipedia for 
# more information.
#
# This rule can be used as a suggestion for the number of bins with which to histogram;
# it is not set in stone, and in the lifetime estimation, the rule is not set in stone.

# fitCentroidstoChargeData()
#
# fitCentroidstoChargeData() is an intermediate function that is called within another intermediate function,
# binAndFitChargeData(), which is itself called within binnedElectronLifetimeFit() to help
# split up the fitting process so as not to make the full fit function extremely long.
# This function takes a histogram with its bin centers and edges, along with an initial guess of
# where the centroid is expected based on the guessed lifetime of the purification data, and 
# it fits a histogram to the data, visualizing many attributes and tracking some statistics
# throughout the process. 
#
# More specifically, this function selects a region within the histogram to fit the Gaussian to, based 
# on the user-guessed lifetime and where the centroid is expected to lie within the data. This 
# sub-region within the histogram is selected to combat noise effects from all the data. The size of
# the subregion is dependent on the interquartile range (IQR) of the data and on the number of events
# histogrammed, with more events corresponding to a narrow range selected.
#
# Many of the inputs and outputs of this function are used for visualization and statistics tracking,
# hence its numerous inputs and outputs. This function is also called within a "for" loop, hence its
# apparently inconsistent variable naming.
#
# NOTE/WARNING: This function is the one that calls scipy.optimize.curve_fit(), and this is the function that
# has some hard-coded values for thresholds based on the statistics from reduced_v9 datasets from
# Run 34. In the future, it would be wise to replace curve_fit() with tools from lmfit, and it would 
# also be wise to determine a more dynamic method of calculating such thresholds that are hard-coded.
# (This message was written at the time of creation, 17 August 2022.)
#
# If curve_fit() fails to converge, then, due to low statistics of the datasets, the mean and std. dev
# of the subregion of the histogram is taken as the centroid and std. dev. thereof for that slice.

# binAndFitChargeData()
#
# binAndFitChargeData() primarily bins all the charge data, then calls fitCentroidstoChargeData()
# to fit the data with Gaussians for each drift slice. A "for" loop is called to bin and fit the 
# data for each drift slice, the slices and thicknesses calculated by cutDriftSlices(). 
#
# Many of the inputs and outputs of this function are for visualization and statistics-recording
# purposes, hence the many inputs.
#
# Quality cuts are applied to charge tile data vs. drift time, including linear cuts on the tile 
# energy as a function of drift time, and from the cut data, the number of hist bins for each slice
# is calculated using twice the suggested value by the Freedman-Diaconis rule. The data is then 
# histogrammed, and the bin centers are formed from the bin edges. The fit is then carried out in
# fitCentroidstoChargeData().

# binAndFitChargeDataChannel()
#
# binAndFitChargeDataChannel() primarily bins all the charge data, then calls fitCentroidstoChargeData()
# to fit the data with Gaussians for each drift slice. A "for" loop is called to bin and fit the 
# data for each drift slice, the slices and thicknesses calculated by cutDriftSlices(). This version
# of the function is for lifetime fits to individual tiles.
#
# Many of the inputs and outputs of this function are for visualization and statistics-recording
# purposes, hence the many inputs.
#
# Quality cuts are applied to charge tile data vs. drift time, including linear cuts on the tile 
# energy as a function of drift time, and from the cut data, the number of hist bins for each slice
# is calculated using twice the suggested value by the Freedman-Diaconis rule. The data is then 
# histogrammed, and the bin centers are formed from the bin edges. The fit is then carried out in
# fitCentroidstoChargeData().

# binnedElectronLifetimeFit()
#
# binnedElectronLifetimeFit() is the main function of this class, the function to be called when
# estimating the lifetime of a purification dataset. It calls cutDriftSlices(), binAndFitChargeData()
# (which itself calls fitCentroidstoChargeData()), and lsLin() to complete this task.
#
# The function passes inputs into cutDriftSlices(), which creates the drift slices in which
# centroids are fit for the actual lifetime fit. The slices are used, then, to calculate the 
# intercept guesses, which are calculated from the user-guessed lifetime and intercept they
# believe the data has. Based on the statistics of the data used to determine the number and 
# sizes (non-uniform) of the drift slices, linear cuts on the tile energy are established for
# the data, which is then passed into binAndFitChargeData() to histogram each slice by tile
# energy and fit those plots to a Gaussian. The centroids (means) of these fits are then passed
# into lsLin(), which fits the natural log of these points to a linear fit, the slope of which
# is the opposite of the reciprocal of the lifetime. 
# 
# Relevant statistics and plots are presented at the discretion of the user.
#
# Many of the current issues (at the time of writing, 17 August 2022) and improvements to this
# function actually exist in the modular functions called by this one; however, switching to 
# lmfit instead of scipy.optimize.curve_fit() and handling the uncertainties of the centroids
# when performing the lifetime fit, also reporting the reduced chi-squared for the final fit and
# for each Gaussian fit would be a major professional improvement.
#
# Inputs:

# binnedElectronLifetimeFitChannel()
#
# binnedElectronLifetimeFitChannel() performs the same function as binnedElectronLifetimeFit() but
# for an individual channel from a dataframe. It calls cutDriftSlices(), binAndFitChargeData()
# (which itself calls fitCentroidstoChargeData()), and lsLin() to complete this task. It has all
# the same inputs and outputs as binnedElectronLifetimeFit(), but with an extra input that specifies
# the channel whose tile energy is being analyzed.
#
# The function passes inputs into cutDriftSlices(), which creates the drift slices in which
# centroids are fit for the actual lifetime fit. The slices are used, then, to calculate the 
# intercept guesses, which are calculated from the user-guessed lifetime and intercept they
# believe the data has. Based on the statistics of the data used to determine the number and 
# sizes (non-uniform) of the drift slices, linear cuts on the tile energy are established for
# the data, which is then passed into binAndFitChargeData() to histogram each slice by tile
# energy and fit those plots to a Gaussian. The centroids (means) of these fits are then passed
# into lsLin(), which fits the natural log of these points to a linear fit, the slope of which
# is the opposite of the reciprocal of the lifetime. 
# 
# Relevant statistics and plots are presented at the discretion of the user.
#
# Many of the current issues (at the time of writing, 17 August 2022) and improvements to this
# function actually exist in the modular functions called by this one; however, switching to 
# lmfit instead of scipy.optimize.curve_fit() and handling the uncertainties of the centroids
# when performing the lifetime fit, also reporting the reduced chi-squared for the final fit and
# for each Gaussian fit would be a major professional improvement.
